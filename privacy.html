      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="sub">
        This Privacy Policy explains how this website collects, uses, shares, and protects information when you browse
        pages on this site. This site is an independent information/guide website and may include outbound links to third-party providers.
      </p>

      <div class="hr"></div>

      <h2>1) What this policy covers</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        This policy applies to information collected through this website only. When you click outbound links and visit third-party
        websites, those sites’ privacy practices apply.
      </p>

      <h2>2) Information we may collect</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        We aim to collect as little personal information as possible. Depending on how the site is configured, we may collect:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Usage data:</b> pages viewed, time on page, clicks, referring/exit pages, and general engagement signals.</li>
        <li><b>Device & technical data:</b> browser type, device type, operating system, approximate location (city/region), and language.</li>
        <li><b>Identifiers for attribution:</b> parameters in links (e.g., UTM tags) and click identifiers used to measure referral performance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal data (such as health, financial account details, or government identifiers)
        through normal website browsing.
      </p>

      <h2>3) Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Cookies are small text files stored on your device. Similar technologies include pixels and local storage. We may use these to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintain basic site functionality and performance.</li>
        <li>Measure traffic and understand which pages are helpful.</li>
        <li>Track outbound clicks so we can understand which links users engage with.</li>
        <li>Support affiliate attribution (so referrals are properly recorded).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        You can control cookies through your browser settings. Blocking cookies may impact some site functionality and analytics accuracy.
      </p>

      <h2>4) Analytics and performance measurement</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        We may use analytics tools to understand how visitors use the site. These tools typically collect usage data and technical data
        such as your browser, device, approximate location, and interactions. This helps us:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improve content and layout.</li>
        <li>Identify errors or performance issues.</li>
        <li>Reduce spam, abuse, and suspicious traffic patterns.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5) Affiliate links and third-party websites</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        This website may contain affiliate links. If you click an affiliate link and take an action on a third-party website
        (such as signing up or making a purchase), we may receive a commission. Affiliate partners may use cookies and tracking
        parameters to attribute referrals. We do not control how third parties collect or use information on their own sites.
      </p>

      <h2>6) How we use information</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Information collected through the site may be used for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Operating and maintaining the website.</li>
        <li>Understanding page performance and improving user experience.</li>
        <li>Measuring marketing/affiliate attribution and preventing fraud.</li>
        <li>Security monitoring (e.g., rate limiting, bot detection, error logging).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7) How information may be shared</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        We may share limited information in the following cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Service providers:</b> hosting, analytics, and security vendors who process data on our behalf.</li>
        <li><b>Affiliate/advertising partners:</b> for attribution and anti-fraud validation (usually through identifiers and event logs).</li>
        <li><b>Legal obligations:</b> if required to comply with laws or valid legal requests.</li>
        <li><b>Business changes:</b> if the site is reorganized, merged, or transferred, information may be included as part of that change.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        We do not sell personal information in the traditional sense. Any data sharing is limited to operating the site, measuring performance,
        or supporting attribution and security.
      </p>

      <h2>8) Data retention</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        We keep information only as long as needed to operate the site, measure performance, comply with legal obligations, and prevent abuse.
        Retention periods vary by data type and system logs.
      </p>

      <h2>9) Security</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information. However, no method of transmission
        over the internet is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>10) International visitors</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        If you access this site from outside the country where the site is operated, your information may be processed in other jurisdictions
        where data protection laws may differ.
      </p>

      <h2>11) Your choices and rights</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your information (such as access, correction, deletion, or objection to certain processing).
        You can also:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use browser controls to limit cookies and tracking technologies.</li>
        <li>Use private browsing modes to reduce local storage.</li>
        <li>Limit link tracking by removing UTM parameters before sharing links (where feasible).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>12) Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        This website is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal
        information from children.
      </p>

      <h2>13) Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” year above reflects the most recent revision.
        Continued use of the site after updates means you accept the updated policy.
